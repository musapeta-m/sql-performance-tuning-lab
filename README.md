# Database Performance & Tuning Lab
This repository is a collection of advanced scripts and case studies for optimizing **SQL Server** and **PostgreSQL** environments.

## 🎯 Focus Areas
* **Wait Stat Analysis:** Identifying if bottlenecks are Disk, CPU, or Network related.
* **Index Optimization:** Finding missing indexes and removing unused ones to reduce I/O.
* **Execution Plan Analysis:** Deep-dives into query operators to eliminate costly scans.

## 🛠️ Included Tools
* **SQL Server:** DMV-based scripts for memory pressure and index fragmentation.
* **PostgreSQL:** `pg_stat_statements` analysis and VACUUM health checks.
